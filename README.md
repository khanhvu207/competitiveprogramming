# Competitive programming

## Local set-up (Mac OS)

I use VSCode and Neovim primarily.

For VSCode, these are the extensions that I'm using:

1. [Competitive Programming Helper (cph)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) for running testcases locally.
2. [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) as a Vim emulator for VSCode.
3. [Clang-Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format) to format C++ code.

For Neovim, see my [init.vim](dot_files/init.vim).

In case you want to compile and run code manually, run:

```bash
make && ./main
```
